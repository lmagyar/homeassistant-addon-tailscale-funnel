## Prerequisites

In order to use this add-on, you'll need a Tailscale account.

It is free to use for personal & hobby projects, up to 20 clients/devices on a
single user account. Sign up using your Google, Microsoft or GitHub account at
the following URL:

<https://login.tailscale.com/start>

<i>Additional prerequisites if you want to access your Home Assistant device
with a Tailscale provided certificate, ie. through the Tailscale Proxy feature
<b>(click to open)</b></i>
</summary>

### Home Assistant configuration for Tailscale Proxy feature

You must configure Home Assistant to **not** use SSL certificates, to be
accessible through plain http connection. The Tailscale https Proxy will access
Home Assistant through `localhost` and will not accept a real certificate,
connection will be closed with `proxy error: x509: cannot validate certificate
for 127.0.0.1 because it doesn't contain any IP SANs`

If you still want to use another https connection to access Home Assistant
through another network, please use the **NGINX Home Assistant SSL proxy**
add-on.

So these lines have to be removed from your `/config/configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
http:
#  ssl_certificate: /ssl/fullchain.pem
#  ssl_key: /ssl/privkey.pem
```

Since Home Assistant by default blocks requests from proxies/reverse proxies,
you need to tell your instance to allow requests from the Tailscale add-on.
In order to do so, add the following lines to your `/config/configuration.yaml`
without changing anything:

```yaml
http:
  use_x_forwarded_for: true
  trusted_proxies:
    - 127.0.0.1
```

**Note**: _There is no need to adapt anything in these lines since the addon
runs on your host network._

under HTTPS Certificates (see [Enabling HTTPS][tailscale_info_https] for more

<i>Additional prerequisites if you want to access your Home Assistant device
directly from the internet, ie. through the Tailscale Funnel feature
<b>(click to open)</b></i>
</summary>

With the Tailscale Funnel feature you can access your Home Assistant instance
from the wider internet using your Tailscale domain (like
`https://homeassistant.tail1234.ts.net`) even from devices **without installed
Tailscale VPN client** (eg. general phones, tablets, laptops).

> **Client** &#8658; _Internet_ &#8658; **Tailscale Funnel** (TCP proxy) &#8658;
  _VPN_ &#8658; **Tailscale Proxy** (https proxy) &#8594; **HA** (http
  web-server)

Without the Tailscale Funnel feature, you will be able to access your Home
Assistant instance only when your devices (eg. phones, tablets, laptops) are
connected to your Tailscale VPN, there will be no Internet &#8658; VPN TCP
proxying for https communication.

See [Tailscale Funnel][tailscale_info_funnel] for more information.

> **Note:** _This is an alpha feature that is invite only. Please go to
  Tailscale's [Settings / Feature Previews page][tailscale_feature], and under
  the **Funnel** section check that you are invited and have access to this
  feature._
  
To use the Tailscale Funnel feature, you need to modify some of your Home
Assistant and Tailscale settings.

be publicly available. You can use the `dig` command (Linux/MacOS) to regularly
check if an A-record is already present for your domain (`dig
<machine-name>.<tailnet-name>.ts.net +short` should return an IP address once
the record is published)._

### Tailscale configuration for Tailscale SSH feature

</details>

## Add-on configuration

```yaml
tags:
  - tag:example
  - tag:homeassistant
log_level: info
```

### Option: `tags`

This option allows you to specify specific ACL tags for this Tailscale
instance. They need to start with `tag:`.

More information: [ACL tags][tailscale_info_acls]

### Option: `log_level`

Optionally enable tailscaled debug messages in the add-on's log. Turn it on only
in case you are troubleshooting, because Tailscale's daemon is quite chatty.

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `notice`: Normal but significant events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`: Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.
